                  <h3>Question 1</h3>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Explain your interest in art and charity, and why you believe that combining the two can have a positive impact on society. (For example: By combining art and charity, a powerful synergy is created. Art possesses unique abilities and influence to inspire, evoke empathy, and spark discussions, thereby generating broader attention and support for charitable causes. Art can break through societal indifference and apathy by providing aesthetic experiences and emotional resonance, enabling deeper understanding and concern for social issues. Additionally, art can offer creative and innovative solutions for charitable organizations and projects, using artistic forms and mediums to disseminate information, change attitudes, and behaviors.)
                    </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Compared with other public media, art is a channel with a more unique personal tone. It facilitates a distinctive way of expressing an artist’s own understanding of this world through visual means. The combination between art and public welfare carries artists’ willingness to raise awareness for social and societal issues through their unique artistic style and creative perspective. Artists transmit information, arouse empathy through their work, and encourage people to participate in the action of solving these problems. Public welfare also includes organizing art exhibits, cultural activities, and public art programs to facilitate the process of community cohesion, cultural heritage, and social participation.

Personally speaking, being able to combine art and charity highlights the social responsibility of artists themselves, allowing the power of art to induce positive impact and renovation. 

                  </p>

                  <h3>Question 2</h3>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Can you share examples of some charity programs or organizations that you have personally participated? And can you provide some background information? </p>
                  </blockquote>

                  <p>
                    In 2022, I did a project at an abandoned old state-owned ceramics factory in Jingdezhen. Using disposed materials, I created a large public sculpture space, hoping to modify local ruins space with my personal artistic language while directing the attention of more audience to the remains of the past eras. 
                  </p>

                  <h3>Question 3</h3>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        What promoted your engagement in charity work? Why did you decide to pursue the combination of art and charity? 
                    </p>
                  </blockquote>

                  <p>
                    As an artist, I believe that a sense of social responsibility should be added to the process of creating art. These products could better socialize with the general public in public spaces. Traditionally speaking, the arts are mostly presented at galleries and museums for people to appreciate. However, modern art increasingly strengthens the concept of bringing art into public space and people’s daily lives. Charity plays an important role in this case. The combination of charity and art is not only a personal expression but also an interactive medium with society. This form could largely inspire people to think, create, and contribute to social development.

I personally hope that I can introduce my art works into public spaces, share them with more people, and encourage conversational interactions. My efforts will contribute to accelerating and generalizing art education, social participation, and art’s positive impacts in society.

                    </p>

                  <h3>Question 4</h3>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        What is the goal and motivation for your participation in charity work? Through art, what kind of changes do you hope to bring to the local community or specific groups? 
                    </p>
                  </blockquote>

                  <p>
                    After seeing traces of the past eras there, I was truly inspired to do something to express my then-feelings. The place that hosted all these relics was an enormous industrial park.The factories there were Soviet-style, left over from the last century. As the renovations of the government-owned enterprises continued, old, nationally owned ceramics factories were gradually eliminated because of their poor earnings and lack of modern elements. Workers were laid off. Even today, some still live in abandoned buildings without water or electricity. However, they stayed strong. They grew their own vegetables, used public toilets for water, and used hidden places for urination and defecation. Yet, on the other side of the wall was the most popular place in Jingde Zhen, Letian Market, where ceramic artists worldwide sell their products. This contrast truly aligns with those anti-Utopian scenes in scientific fiction.
